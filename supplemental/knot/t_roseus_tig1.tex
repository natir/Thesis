    \caption{Canu \textsl{T. roseus} tig1 reconstruction. Plain lines denote path without branches in the SG (the one shown Figure \ref{fg:t_roseus_projection}). Boxes denote reads at contig extremities. Dashed lines denote overlaps between reads (and then contig extremities). Arrows show the path used by Canu to build tig1: it goes through the "loop" before going back.}
